# FEC Efiling

## About this project

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) releases information to the public about money that’s raised and spent in federal elections — that’s elections for US president, Senate, and House of Representatives.

Are you interested in seeing how much money a candidate raised? Or spent? How much debt they took on? Who contributed to their campaign? The FEC is the authoritative source for that information.

The FEC gets information on campaign contributions and expenditures from reports filed by candidates, committees, parties, and PACs. Efiling is when they file these reports electronically using the FEC's free software, FECfile, or other commercial software.

This goal of this project is to discover how people are using efiling and how they'd like to use it, in order to understand what changes the FEC might want to make.
